## ##Store_api
welcome to my repository of my first project.Now let me introduce this project to you.

**#introduction**

 This is a REST API which can be used by android and web apps,the sole purpose of making this API is to reduce human effort in a usual general store.
 it allows the employee of the store to organize the data of the items in a general store to in a Database which can be easily manipulated as per the use of the store.This will reduce Human effort as the customer does not have to physically visit the store ,to check if a certain item is present in a store and how much will it cost him.The customer can easily see the items available in a store through his android device or personel computer .Moreover it will help the sales of the store by making it available for a whole new community (internet).
 First of all the database contains 4 categories in which the items of the store is divided . Which are 

 - Household
 - Groceries
 - Dairy
 - Electronics

Now the categories can be accessed both the users and the employee .But,the only difference will the access provided to each of them.


**#for users**


Users will have restricted access to the database . The customer can only know what item is present in the store of a category along with the price,discount available,and discounted price.


**#for employee** 


Now the employee will have full acccess to the the database and will have the following privileges

 - insert an item in a category
 - change the cost of item
 - delete an item
 - put discount of a category
 - change discount of category
 - delete discount of category
 - insert another employee account to the database
 - change his/her own password  
 - delete the account of another employee
 - see how many employee's are currently in the database
 

**#conclusion**


 It is recommended for you to read readme.documentation for brief documentation of the API for various endpoints through which the API is implemented and can use for you android/web application.
